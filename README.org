* ~org-fragtog~
Automatically toggle org-mode latex fragment previews as the cursor enters and exits them
** About
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]] supports inline image previews of latex fragments. These can be toggled with @@html:<kbd>@@ C-c C-x C-l @@html:</kbd>@@. ~org-fragtog~ automates this, so fragment previews are disabled for editing when your cursor steps onto them, and re-enabled when the cursor leaves.

** Setup
Install and load the package, then add the snippet below to your config.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'org-fragtog-mode)
#+end_src

Note that ~org-fragtog~ requires a newer version of ~org-mode~ than what is currently distributed with Emacs. You can get the latest version of Org from [[https://orgmode.org/elpa.html][Org ELPA]].
